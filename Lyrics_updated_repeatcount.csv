In English
Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears,
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears,
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us.
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up in the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find
Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings
Your love has given me wings

Friendly little purple people eater


What a sight to see (owwww)

(banjo intro)
In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two-three, with a-one-two-three)
We looked down a river
(Hut-two)
And we see'd the British come
(Three-four)
And there must have been a hundred of'em
(Hut-two)
Beatin' on the drums
(Three-four)
They stepped so high
(Hut-two)
And they made their bugles ring
(Three-four)
We stood by our cotton bales
(Hut-two)
And didn't say a thing
(Two-three-four)
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
(One-hut, two-three-four)
If we didn't fire our muskets
(One-hut, two-three-four)
'Till we looked 'em in the eye
(One-hut, two-three-four)
We held our fire
(Hut, two-three-four)
'Till we see'd their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave 'em - well we
Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(One-hup-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(Hup-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast
(Hup-two)
That the hounds couldn't catch 'em
(One-two-three-four)
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
(One-two, hup-two-three-four)
We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind
We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Yeah, they ran through the briars
(Hup-one-two)
And they ran through the brambles
(One-two-three-four)
And they ran through the bushes
(Hup-two)
Where the rabbit couldn't go
(Hup-two-three-four)
They ran so fast

Among the pine trees half forlorn

Little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Were for baby Jimmy Brown
Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
Lead us not into temptation,
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Beneath the mountains high above
And there, twenty years thereafter
Jimmy was to meet his love

Was a great day in his life

Were for Jimmy and his wife

In the little valley town
Twas farewell that it was singing

Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm

Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care for it knows
There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams
All their love

Running Bear,Johnny Preston,1960,4,https://www.songlyrics.com/johnny-preston/running-bear-lyrics/,"On the bank of the river
Stood running bear
Young Indian brave

'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach the little white dove

El Paso,Marty Robbins,1960,15,https://www.songlyrics.com/marty-robbins/el-paso-lyrics/,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl
Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain, I could tell
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring
A drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina
The girl that I loved
So in anger I
Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one
It looked like it could run
Up on its back
And away I did ride
Just as fast as I
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in lifenothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow
A bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this
Pain in my heart
And at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying
To stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary
Unable to ride
But my love for
Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina, good-bye",el paso; my love; i am; in my; in the; the west; west texas; and away; as i; away i,4

That too many people have died?

You can always go - downtown.

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go downtown
Things will be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure downtown
Everything's waiting for you.
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown.
Maybe you know some little places to go to
where they never close downtown.
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over
happy again.
The lights are much brighter there
you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
so go - downtown
Where all the lights are bright downtown
waiting for you tonight downtown
you're gonna be alright now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
guide them along.

What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,Jimmy Ruffin,1966,3,https://www.songlyrics.com/jimmy-ruffin/what-becomes-of-the-brokenhearted-lyrics/,"As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, maybe
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a-tumblin' down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who cares
Always moving and goin' nowhere
What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind, help me please
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

And biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know
They will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To Sir, with love
The time has come for closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave I know
That I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong
That's a lot to learn, what
can I give you in return?
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a star
But I, would rather you let me give my heart

Ode to Billie Joe,Bobbie Gentry,1967,3,https://www.songlyrics.com/bobbie-gentry/ode-to-billie-joe-lyrics/,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""Y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge

To spend an evening with me

You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid
Like: ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true
It never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

Honey,Bobby Goldsboro,1968,3,https://www.songlyrics.com/bobby-goldsboro/honey-lyrics/,"See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran
Out to brush the snow away so it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself, I laughed 'til I cried
She was always young at heart
Kind a dumb and kind a smart and I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her when
I came home from working late 'cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad but what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say, she saw through me and hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly in middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and Robin's sing, she went away
And honey, I miss you and I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you if only I could
Yes, one day while I wasn't home
While she was there and all alone, the angels came
Now all I have is memories of honey
And I wake up nights and call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where honey lived and honey played and love grew up
A small cloud passes over head
And cries down in the flower bed that honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown","and she; she was; to be; and honey,; and i; and i'd; and i'm; and it; be with; being good",6

'Bout a Harper Valley widowed wife

And didn't even stop to play

From the Harper Valley PTA""
Well, the note says, ""Mrs. Johnson
You're wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin'
And a runnin' 'round with men and goin' wild""

Was gonna meet that very afternoon
And boy were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, ""I'd like to address this meeting
Of the Harper Valley PTA""
""Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away""
""And Mr. Baker, can you tell us
Why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told
To keep her window shades all pulled completely down?""
""Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you'll smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin""
""And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as a mother I not fit
Well, this is just a little Payton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites""

And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way

Spill the Wine,Eric Burdon & War,1970,20,https://www.songlyrics.com/eric-burdon-war/spill-the-wine-lyrics/,"I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
In a big field of tall grass
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face
As I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind
The fact that me, an overfed long-haired leaping gnome
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hm
But there I was, mm
I was taken to a place
The hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top
Naked to the world
In front of
Every kind of girl
There was long ones, tall ones, short ones, brown ones
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear
Something crazy
She said
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
I thought to myself, what could that mean?
Am I going crazy, or is this just a dream?
Now wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said
Take the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl, uh-huh, uh-huh

Take that pearl, yeah

You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything

You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

But you turned into a lover and
Mother what a lover, you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore
You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand

They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife
Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

Locked us on this reservation

Me and Bobby McGee,Janis Joplin,1971,11,https://www.songlyrics.com/janis-joplin/me-and-bobby-mcgee-lyrics/,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge waitin' for a train
And I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
It rode us all the way into New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' don't mean nothin' honey if it ain't free
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, Bobby sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything that we'd done
So Bobby baby, he kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, Bobby sang the blues
I said feelin' good was good enough for me, mmm hmm

American Pie,Don McLean,1972,3,https://www.songlyrics.com/don-mclean/american-pie-lyrics/,"A long, long time ago, I can still remember


How that music used to make me smile


And I knew if I had my chance


That I could make those people dance


And maybe they'd be happy for a while


But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver


Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step


I can't remember if I cried, when I read about his widowed bride


But something touched me deep inside the day the music died


So bye, bye Miss American Pie


Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry


And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye


Singing this'll be the day that I die


This'll be the day that I die


Did you write the book of love


And do you have faith in God above


If the Bible tells you so?


Now do you believe in rock and roll?


Can music save your mortal soul?


And can you teach me how to dance real slow?


Well, I know that you're in love with him


'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym


You both kicked off your shoes


Man, I dig those rhythm and blues


I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck


With a pink carnation and a pickup truck


But I knew I was out of luck


The day the music died


I started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie


Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry


Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye


And singing this'll be the day that I die


This'll be the day that I die


Now, for ten years we've been on our own


And moss grows fat on a rolling stone


But that's not how it used to be


When the jester sang for the king and queen


In a coat he borrowed from James Dean


And a voice that came from you and me


Oh, and while the king was looking down


The jester stole his thorny crown


The courtroom was adjourned


No verdict was returned


And while Lenin read a book on Marx


The quartet practiced in the park


And we sang 'Dirges In The Dark'


The day the music died


We were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie


Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry


Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye


And singing this'll be the day that I die


This'll be the day that I die


Helter skelter in a summer swelter


The birds flew off with a fallout shelter


Eight miles high and falling fast


Landed foul on the grass


The players tried for a forward pass


With the jester on the sidelines in a cast


Now the half time air was sweet perfume


While sergeants played a marching tune


We all got up to dance


Oh, but we never got the chance


'Cause the players tried to take the field


The marching band refused to yield


Do you recall what was revealed


The day the music died?


We started singing bye, bye Miss American Pie


Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry


Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye


And singing this'll be the day that I die


This'll be the day that I die


Oh, and there we were all in one place


A generation lost in space


With no time left to start again


So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick


Jack Flash sat on a candlestick


'Cause fire is the devil's only friend


Oh, and as I watched him on the stage


My hands were clenched in fists of rage


No angel born in hell


Could break that Satan's spell


And as the flames climbed high into the night


To light the sacrificial rite


I saw Satan laughing with delight


The day the music died


He was singing bye, bye Miss American Pie


Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry


Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye


And singing this'll be the day that I die


This'll be the day that I die


I met a girl who sang the blues


And I asked her for some happy news


But she just smiled and turned away


I went down to the sacred store


Where I'd heard the music years before


But the man there said the music wouldn't play


And in the streets the children screamed


The lovers cried and the poets dreamed


But not a word was spoken


The church bells all were broken


And the three men I admire most


The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost


They caught the last train for the coast


The day the music died


And they were singing bye, bye Miss American Pie


Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry


Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye


Singing this'll be the day that I die

Brandy (Youre a Fine Girl),Looking Glass,1972,12,https://www.songlyrics.com/looking-glass/brandy-youre-a-fine-girl-lyrics/,"Do do do do do do do do ...
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves a hundred ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time a way
And talk about their homes
There's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
She serves them whisky and wine
The sailors say...
Brandy, you're a fine girl
(you're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(such a fine girl)
Your eyes could steal a sailor from the sea
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the north of spain
A locket that bears the name of the man that Brandy loves
He came on a summers day - bearing gifts - from far away
But he made it clear he couldnt stay
The harbor was his home
Brandy, you're a fine girl
(you're a fine girl)
What a good wife you would be
(such a fine girl)
Brandy used to watch his eyes
As he told his sailor stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory
But he had always told the truth
Lord he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a slient town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
She hears him say...","do do; a fine; fine girl); (such a; (you're a; a good; be (such; brandy, you're; but he; fine girl",0

Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own

Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well 'Crocodile Rocking' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy Mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the 'Crocodile Rocking' was out of the sight

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Where the children laugh and the children play

In a world that used to be, close your eyes and follow me
Where the children laugh and the children play

We're gonna let them visit their grandma, that's what we're gonna do

Spiders and Snakes,Jim Stafford,1974,16,https://www.songlyrics.com/jim-stafford/spiders-and-snakes-lyrics/,"I remember when Mary Lou said
'You wanna walk me home from school'
And I said, 'Yes, I do'
She said, 'I don't have to go right home
And I'm the kind that likes to be alone
As long as you would'
I said, 'Me, too'
And so we took a stroll
Wound up down by the swimmin' hole
And she said, 'Do what you want to do'
I got silly and I found a frog
In the water by a hollow log
And I shook it at her
And I said 'This frog's for you'
She said...
Chorus:
'I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
You fool, you fool
I don't like spiders and snakes
And that ain't what it takes to love me
Like I want to be loved by you'
Well, I think of that girl from time to time
I call her up when I got a dime
I say, ""Hello, baby'
She says, 'Ain't you cool'
I say, 'Do you remember when?
And would you like to get together again?'
She says, 'I'll see you after school'
I was shy and so for a while
Most of my love was touch and smile
Til she said, 'Come on over here'
I was nervous as you might guess
Still looking for somethin' to slip down her dress
And she said, 'Let's make it perfectly clear'

At Seventeen,Janis Ian,1975,20,https://www.songlyrics.com/janis-ian/at-seventeen-lyrics/,"I learned the truth at seventeen
That love was meant for beauty queens
And high school girls with clear skinned smiles
Who married young and then retired.
The valentines I never knew
The Friday night charades of youth
Were spent on one more beautiful
At seventeen I learned the truth
And those of us with ravaged faces
Lacking in the social graces
Desperately remained at home
Inventing lovers on the phone
Who called to say come dance with me
and murmured vague obscenities
It isn't all it seems
At seventeen
A brown eyed girl in hand me downs
Whose name I never could pronounce
Said, ""Pity please the ones who serve,
They only get what they deserve""
The rich relationed hometown queen
Marries into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And haven for the elderly
Remember those who win the game
Lose the love they sought to gain
Indebentures of quality
And dubious integrity
Their small town eyes will gape at you
In dull surprise when payment due
Exceeds accounts received
At seventeen
To those of us who know the pain
of valentines that never came
And those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all they gave for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown

The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
She said, it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover
You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee

Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
You just listen to me
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free
She said, it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said, I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways
She said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover

But it's a real beauty

Do You Wanna Make Love,Peter McCann,1977,17,https://www.songlyrics.com/peter-mccann/do-you-wanna-make-love-lyrics/,"Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon
Lose all their meaning with the rising moon
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else
Take all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously or take it somewhere else
If you wanna get close to me
You could do it so easily
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes
Or just another empty lie?
Do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down, if you try and fool yourself
Well, do you wanna make love or do you just want to fool around?

Sir Duke,Stevie Wonder,1977,18,https://www.songlyrics.com/stevie-wonder/sir-duke-lyrics/,"Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget now
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

Hotel California,Eagles,1977,19,https://www.songlyrics.com/eagles/hotel-california-lyrics/,"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair


Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air


Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light


My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim


I had to stop for the night


There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell


Then I was thinking to myself this could be Heaven or this could be Hell


Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way


There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say


""Welcome to the Hotel California


Such a lovely place


(Such a lovely place)


Such a lovely face


Plenty of room at the Hotel California


Any time of year


(Any time of year)


You can find it here""


Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz


She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends


How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat


Some dance to remember, some dance to forget


So I called up the captain, ""Please bring me my wine""


He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""


And still those voices are calling from far away


Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say


""Welcome to the Hotel California


Such a lovely place


(Such a lovely place)


Such a lovely face


They're living it up at the Hotel California


What a nice surprise


(What a nice surprise)


Bring your alibis""


Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice


And she said, ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device""


And in the master's chambers they gathered for the feast


They stab it with their steely knives but they just can't kill the beast


Last thing I remember I was running for the door


I had to find the passage back to the place I was before


""Relax,"" said the night man, ""We are programmed to receive


You can check out any time you like but you can never leave""",a lovely; in the; hotel california; such a; the hotel; for the; i was; the night; to the; you can,4

Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul

Miss You,The Rolling Stones,1978,16,https://www.songlyrics.com/the-rolling-stones/miss-you-lyrics/,"I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
""Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you""
""We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to""
Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come home, come home?

Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Ask me people, ""What's the matter with you boy?""
Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say
I won't miss you child
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else

Fooling on my time

I need to know that you will always be


The same old someone that I knew


Ah, what will it take till you believe in me?


The way that I believe in you?


I said I love you and that's forever


And this I promise from the heart

We can make this whole damn thing work out.
With a little love, we can lay it down.
Can't you feel the town exploding?
There is no end to what we can do together.
There is no end, there is no end.
The wiliow turns his back on inclement weather;
And if he can do it, we can do it, just me and you,
And a little luck, we can clear it up.
We can bring it in for a landing,
With a little luck, we can turn it on.
There can be no misunderstanding.
There is no end to what we can do together.
There is no end, there is no end.
The willow turns his back on inclement weather;
We can do it, just me and you.
With a little push, we could set it off.
We can send it rocketing skywards.
With a little love, we could shake it up.

I said, I was down and out with the blues.


I felt no man cared if I were alive.


I felt the whole world was so tight ...


that's when someone came up to me,


and said, young man, take a walk up the street.


there's a place there called the y.m.c.a.


they can start you back on your way.


it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.


it's fun to stay at the y-m-c-a.


they have everything for you men to enjoy,


you can hang out with all the boys ...


y-m-c-a ... you'll find it at the y-m-c-a.


young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.


young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.

young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.


young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.

Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies

Its Still Rock and Roll to Me,Billy Joel,1980,9,https://www.songlyrics.com/billy-joel/its-still-rock-and-roll-to-me-lyrics/,"What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive.
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me.
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene.
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummell baby
If you just give it half a chance.
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much.
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock & roll to me.

The Rose,Bette Midler,1980,10,https://www.songlyrics.com/bette-midler/the-rose-lyrics/,"Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower and you, it's only seed
It's the heart, afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying that never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the rose","is a; it is; love, it; say love,; afraid of; and the; it's the; some say; that never; been too",1
Escape (The PiÃ±a Colada Song),Rupert Holmes,1980,11,https://www.songlyrics.com/rupert-holmes/escape-the-pia-colada-song-lyrics/,"I was tired of my lady
We'd been together to long
Like a warn out recording of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping
I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns
There was this letter I read
If you like pina colada's
And gettin' caught in the rain
If your not into yoga
If you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for
Write to me and escape
I didn't think about my lady
I know that sounds kinda mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper
Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet
I thought it wasn't half bad
Yes I like pina colada's
And gettin' caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called o'malley's
Where we'll plan our escape
So I waited with high hopes
And she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady
And she said oh its you
Then we laughed for a moment
And I said I never knew that you like pina colada's
And gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
And the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
In the dunes on the cape
Your the lady I've looked for
Come with me and escape

Lady


Lady, I'm your knight in shining armour


And I love you


You've made me what I am


And I am yours


My love, there's so many ways


I want to say I love you


Let me hold you in my arms


Forever more


You have gone and made me such a fool


I'm so lost in your love


And all we belong together


Won't you believe in my song


Lady, for so many years I'd thought


I'd never find you


You have come into my life and made me whole


Forever let me wake to see you


Each and every morning


Let me hear you whisper softly in my ears


In my eyes I see no one else but you


There's no other love like our love


And yes, oh yes


I'll always want you near me


I've waited for you for so long


Lady your love is the only love I need


And beside me is where I want you to be


Because my love there is something I want you to know


You're the love of my life


You're my lady",in my; i want; let me; made me; want you; and i; and made; for so; i am; i love,5
(Just Like) Starting Over,John Lennon,1981,4,https://www.songlyrics.com/john-lennon/just-like-starting-over-lyrics/,"Our life together is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere alone
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over
Why don't we take off alone?
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Jessies Girl,Rick Springfield,1981,5,https://www.songlyrics.com/rick-springfield/jessies-girl-lyrics/,"Jessie is a friend, yeah
I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body, I just know it
Yeah 'n' he's holding her in his arms late, late at night
You know
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that
I play along with the charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her,
But the point is probably moot
'Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body, I just know it

Ain't that the way love supposed to be

I can't believe it myself.


Suddenly I'm up on top of the world,


should have been somebody else.


Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.


I never thought I could feel so free.


Flying away on a wing and a prayer,


Who could it be?


Believe it or not, it's just me.


Looks like the light of a new day,


Hit me from out of the blue.


Breaking me out of the spell I was in,


Making all of my wishes come true.


Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.


I never thought I could feel so free.


Flying away on a wing and a prayer,


Who could it be?


Believe it or not, it's just me.


This is to good to be true.


Look at me, fallin' for you.

The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again

And it's finger popping
Twenty four hour shopping in Rapture
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly

And out comes the man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars, where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek

Said don't stop to the punk rock
Back to back, body muscular

One to one, tea time technology
And a  digital ardour, no sign of saviour in Rapture
Well now you see what you wanna be, just have your party on T.V
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars where the T.V's on
And now he's gone, back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race

The lazy sway of the trees


I saw the look in your eyes, lookin' into mine


Seeing what you wanted to see

What your body's sayin' to mine


I'm tired of fast moves I've got a slow groove


On my mind


I want a man with a slow hand


I want a lover with an easy touch


I want somebody who will spend some time


Not come and go in a heated rush


I want somebody who will understand


When it comes to love, I want a slow hand


On shadowed ground, with no one around


And a blanket of stars in our eyes


We are drifting free, like two lost leaves


On the crazy wind of the night


Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard

Foolin' around

So I made you my wife
Since then I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, oooh, I love you
You came along
From far away
And found me here
I was playin' around
Feeling down
Hittin' the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile
You said, you're much too young
Your life ain't begun
let's walk for awhile
And as my head was spinnin' 'round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh, I want you
Thank you, babe, for being a friend
And shinin' your light in my life

The love we share seems to go nowhere,


And I've lost my life,


For I toss and turn; I can't sleep at night.

Once I ran to you, now I run from you.


This tainted love you've given,


I gave you all a boy could give you.


Take my tears and that's not really all. . .

Now I know I've got to. . . run away,


I've got to. . . get away.


You don't really want any more from me.


To make things right you need someone to  hold you tight,


And you think love is to pray,


But I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

I love you though you hurt me so.


Now I'm gonna pack my things and go.

Waiting For A Girl Like You
So long


I've been looking too hard, I've waiting too long


Sometimes I don't know what I will find


I only know it's a matter of time


When you love someone


When you love someone


It feels so right, so warm and true


I need to know if you feel it too


Maybe I'm wrong


Won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong?


This heart of mine has been hurt before


This time I wanna be sure


I've been waiting for a girl like you


To come into my life


I've been waiting for a girl like you


A love that will survive


I've been waiting for someone new


To make me feel alive


Yeah, waiting for a girl like you


To come into my life


You're so good


When we make love it's understood


It's more than a touch or a word we say


Only in dreams could it be this way


When you love someone


Yeah, really love someone


Now, I know it's right


From the moment I wake up till deep in the night


There's no where on earth that I'd rather be


Than holding you, tenderly


I've been waiting for a girl like you


To come into my life


I've been waiting for a girl like you


And a love that will survive


I've been waiting for someone new


To make me feel alive

Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance
It can cut you like a knife, if the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
(crazy! crazy! crazy! crazy!)
On the ice-blue line of insanity is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery: touch it, but can't hold it.
You work all your life for that moment in time, it could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
There's a cold kinetic heat, struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her head against the wind

There's a guy starting to realize


That he's eternal fate has turn it's back on him

I'm sitting here waitin' the gun still warm


Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances


Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head


Wrapped up in silence all circuits are dead


Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy


Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone

This far from the borderline

He knows damn well he has been cheated

Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother

Feel how it trembles inside

There's a phrase fits

I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And that's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight
That I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you at all
No matter what my heart might say
Well there's a message in the wild
And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know, how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world, I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line
But I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you at all
No matter what heart might say
And there's a message that I'm sending out

There's something happening somewhere

I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look
You can't start a fire
Sitting 'round crying over a broken heart

If I should find a helping hand, oh woah

Time After Time,Cyndi Lauper,1984,17,https://www.songlyrics.com/cyndi-lauper/time-after-time-lyrics/,"Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in the circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say ""Go slow""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen
From deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

We Are The World
Written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie


There comes a time when we heed a certain call


When the world must come together as one


There are people dying


And it's time to lend a hand to life,


The greatest gift of all


We can go on pretending day by day


That someone, somewhere will soon make a change


We are all a part of God's great big family


And the truth you know love is all wee need


We are the world


We are the children


We are the ones who make a brighter day


So let's start giving


There's a choice we're making


We're saving our own lives


It's true we'll make a better day


Just you and me


Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares


And their lives will be stronger and free


As God has shown us by turning stones to bread


So we all must lend a helping hand


We are the world


We are the children


We are the ones who make a brighter day


So let's start giving


There's a choice we're making


We're saving our own lives


It's true we'll make a better day


Just you and me


When you're down and out


There seems no hope at all


But if you just believe there's no way we can fall


Let us realize that a change can only come


When we stand together as one


We are the world


We are the children


We are the ones who make a brighter day


So let's start giving


There's a choice we're making


We're saving our own lives


It's true we'll make a better day

Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy

Now here I stand
I wonder why
I'm on my own
Why did it end this way

This wasn't how it was supposed to be

Rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Venting years of frustrations

Against the ropes

Or Man against Man?
Can any nation stand alone?

An unquenchable thirst

Though his body says stop
His spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul
A quiet ember

It's the paradox
That drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

Kyrie eleison


Kyrie


The wind blows hard against this mountain side


Across the sea into my soul


It reaches into where I cannot hide


Setting my feet upon the road


My heart is old, it holds my memories


My body burns a gemlike flame


Somewhere between the soul and soft machine


Is where I find myself again


Kyrie eleison, down the road that I must travel


Kyrie eleison, through the darkness of the night


Kyrie eleison, where I'm going, will you follow?


Kyrie eleison, on a highway in the light


When I was young I thought of growing old


Of what my life would mean to me


Would I have followed down my chosen road


Or only wished what I could be

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh way oh)
They spin the clubs cruise down the block
All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh way oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian
All the cops in the donut shop say

I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone
How do I get you alone
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
and I was going to tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
and my love for you is still unknown

And the sun begins to fade,


Still enough time to figure out


How to chase my blues away,


I've done alright up to now


It's the light of day that shows me how


And when the night falls, my loneliness calls


Chorus:


Oh, I wanna dance with somebody,


I wanna feel the heat with somebody


Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,


With somebody who loves me


Oh, I wanna dance with somebody,


I wanna feel the heat with somebody


Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,


With somebody who loves me


I've been in love and lost my senses


Spinning through the town,


Sooner or later, the fever ends


And I wind up feeling down


I need a man who'll take that chance,


On a love that burns hot enough to last


So when the night falls,


My lonely heart calls


Chorus:


Oh, I wanna dance with somebody,


I wanna feel the heat with somebody


Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,


With somebody who loves me


Oh, I wanna dance with somebody,


I wanna feel the heat with somebody


Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,


With somebody who loves me


Somebody who, somebody who,


Somebody who loves me yeah


Somebody who, somebody who

The Way It Is
Standing in line marking time-


Waiting for the welfare dime

As he catches the poor ladies' eyes


Just for fun he says ""get a job""


CHORUS


That's just the way it is


Some things will never change


That's just the way it is


But don't you believe them


They say he little boy you can't go


Where the others go


'Cause you don't look like they do


Said hey old man how can you stand


To think that way


Did you really think about it


Before you made the rules


He said, Son


CHORUS


Well they passed a law in '64


To give those who ain't got a little more


But it only goes so far


Because the law don't change another's mind


When all it sees at the hiring time


Is the line on the color bar

Did you think I would curse you or say things to hurt you

Now come on, you know me too well
How could I hurt you when darling, I love you?
And you know I'd never hurt you, woah oh
What do you think I would give at this moment?
If you'd stay, I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees, kiss the ground

Reminds me of childhood memories

I'd probably break down and cry

As if they thought of rain

And see an ounce of pain

And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by, aye

And I feel so lonely


Touching heat freezing on my skin

Wherever you go, I'll be with you


Whatever you want, I'll give it to you


Whenever you need someone to lay your heart and head upon


Remember after the fire, after all the rain


I will be the flame, I will be the flame


Watching shadows move across the wall


It feels so frightening


I wanna run to you, I wanna call


But I've been hit by lightening


Just can't stand up for fallin' apart


Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you

A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle

Then delay my system when you are near 


Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin'

Giving You the Best That I Got,Anita Baker,1989,10,https://www.songlyrics.com/anita-baker/giving-you-the-best-that-i-got-lyrics/,"Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach
The scales are sometimes unbalanced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, baby
Yes, I tell you now, that I made a vow
I'm giving you the best that I got, honey
Everybody's got opinions
'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby
Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home
My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I wanna sing it forever
We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now

I hear your voice on the line

That I thought would last somehow

Something's there we can't deny...


And when i first knew


Was when i first looked at you


And if i can't find my way


If salvation seems worlds away

It Must Have Been Love,Roxette,1990,2,https://www.songlyrics.com/roxette/it-must-have-been-love-lyrics/,"It must have been love but it's over now


Lay a whisper on my pillow


Leave the winter on the ground


I wake up lonely, there's air of silence


In the bedroom and all around


Touch me now, I close my eyes


And dream away


It must have been love but it's over now


It must have been good but I lost it somehow


It must have been love but it's over now


From the moment we touched till the time had run out


Make believing we're together


That I'm sheltered by your heart


But in and outside, I turned to water


Like a teardrop in your palm


And it's a hard winter's day


I dream away


It must have been love but it's over now


It was all that I wanted, now, I'm living without


It must have been love but it's over now

Nothing Compares 2 U
It's been seven hours and fifteen days


Since u took your love away


I go out every night and sleep all day


Since u took your love away


Since u been gone I can do whatever I want


I can see whomever I choose


I can eat my dinner if a fancy restaurant


But nothing


I said nothing can take away these blues


'Cos nothing compares


Nothing compares 2 U


It's been so lonely without u here


Like a bird without a song


Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling


Tell me baby where did I go wrong


I could put my arms around every boy I see


But they'd only remind me of you


I went to the doctor guess what he told me


Guess what he told me


He said girl u better have fun no matter what u do


but he's a fool


'Cos nothing compares 2 U


All the flowers that u planted mama


In the back yard


All died when u went away


I knew that living with u baby was sometimes hard


But I'm willing to give it another try


'Cos nothing compares

Poison, uh
Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
Situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
It's all so beautiful
Relationships they seem from the start
It's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart, yeah
But it's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her
That girl is poison, ooh
Never trust a big butt and smile
She's poison
If I were you I'd take precautions
Before I start to leave fly girl
'Cause in some portions
She's the best thing in the world, ooh
She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' dreamin'

That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her
That girl is poison, uuuh
Never trust a big butt and smile
She's poison
They told me
Never give in to tentation
No correlation with love and affection
Is it fact or is it fiction?
Is she into me or is she into Rixton?
They sey that she'll never change
I can feel her running through my veins
My veins, my veins
My veins, my veins
She's running through my veins, yeah
She won't change, won't change
That girl is poison, oh
Never trust a big butt and smile

Vision of Love,Mariah Carey,1990,6,https://www.songlyrics.com/mariah-carey/vision-of-love-lyrics/,"Treated me kind sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights, felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong, so I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized the love that came to be
Feel so alive, I'm so thankful that I perceived
The answer that Heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny

And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me

Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool


With my home girl, Paula Abdul


Baby seems we never ever agree


You like the movies and I like TV


I take things serious and you take 'em light


I go to bed early and I party all night


Our friends are sayin' we ain't gonna last


'Cuz I move slowly and baby I'm fast


I like it quiet and I love to shout


But when we get together, it just all works out


I take two steps forward, I take two steps back


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


Who'd a thought we could be lovers


She makes the bed and he steals the covers


She likes it neat and he makes a mess


I take it easy baby, I get obsessed


She's got the money and he's always broke


I don't like cigarettes, I like to smoke


Things in common, there just ain't a one


But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun


I take two steps forward, two steps back


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


You know it baby, baby


Nothing in common but this trust


I'm like a minus, she's like a plus


One going up, one coming down


But we seem to land on common ground


When things go wrong we make corrections


To keep things moving in the right direction


Try to fight it but I'm telling you Jack


It's useless, opposites attract


Baby ain't it somethin' how we lasted this long


You and me provin' everyone wrong


Don't think we'll ever get our differences patched


Don't really matter 'cuz we're perfectly matched


I take two steps forward, I take two steps back


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


Two steps forward, two steps back


We come together 'cuz opposites attract


And you know it ain't fiction just a natural fact

All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You,Heart,1990,16,https://www.songlyrics.com/heart/all-i-wanna-do-is-make-love-to-you-lyrics/,"It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up alongside and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile, so we drove for a while
I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right, is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong just stay for the night
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to
So we found this hotel, It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night, oh he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him, ""I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden, we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to
We made love, love like strangers
All night long we made love
Then it happened one day we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said, ""Please, please understand, I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me was the one little thing that you can""
All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you

Close to You,Maxi Priest,1990,17,https://www.songlyrics.com/maxi-priest/close-to-you-lyrics/,"She was a Jezebel, this burstin' queen
Livin' her life like a bad sweet dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear
Spinnin' around like a wheel on fire
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream
Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holdin' me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back but she goes too far
Windin' me up just to let me down
So emotional gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal risin' I was scared
I think I was possessed
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
She had an attitude I can't explain
You never know if you're in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt
Her blood was hot she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
She was a Jezebel, this burstin' queen

Just to let you know, exactly the way I feel
To let you know my love's so real
Because I love you, I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be a light, to be your guide
If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around
Because I love you, my heart's an open door
So won't you please come on in
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be a light, to be your guide","because i; i love; love you,; to be; you, i'll; a light,; and that; be a; be right; be your",0
Someday,Mariah Carey,1991,13,https://www.songlyrics.com/mariah-carey/someday-lyrics/,"You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing for the grass would be greener
You told yourself, ""I just don't need her now""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time
When you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore
Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay
'Cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, someday
One you gave away
Will be the only one you're wishing for

From a Distance,Bette Midler,1991,15,https://www.songlyrics.com/bette-midler/from-a-distance-lyrics/,"From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man
God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for
From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves

But that was all before he came


I thought love had to hurt to turn out right


But now he's here, it's not the same, it's not the same


He fills me up, he gives me love


More love than I've ever seen


He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world


But he's all the man that I need


And in the morning when I kiss his eyes


He takes me down and rocks me slow


And in the evening when the moon is high


He holds me close and won't let go, he won't let go


He fills me up, he gives me love


More love than I've ever seen


He's all I've got, he's all I've got in this world

You'll be mine forever baby, you just see
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever, said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say good-bye?
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head oh I'd rather be dead

You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I
Can you love me again like you loved me before?

Baby Got Back,Sir Mix-a-Lot,1992,2,https://www.songlyrics.com/sir-mixalot/baby-got-back-lyrics/,"Oh, my, God Becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends.
But, ya know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because,
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there
I mean gross, look
She's just so, black
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I want to get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But with that butt you got makes (me so horny)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you want to get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas (yeah) Fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt

And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I want to get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I want to get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I want to fuck
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies (Yeah) Ladies (Yeah)
If you want to role in my Mercedes (Yeah)
Then turn around, stick it out
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back
Baby got back
Yeah, baby, when it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection
Thirty six-twenty- four-thirty six
Ha ha, only if she's 5'3
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda, playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers want to play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gol'
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round,
And you want a triple X throw down,
Dial 1-900-MIXALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts

Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips

Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

It's in my blood and it's all around
I loved you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the ends
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
There's no load I can't hold
A road so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

Weak,SWV,1993,6,https://www.songlyrics.com/swv/weak-lyrics/,"I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way

It's a feeling that I don't understand
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing
It's not a phase, I want you to stay with me
By my side, I swallow my pride
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your loving makes me weak
Time after time, after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong, it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down
When you're around, cries fading
In my condition, I don't want to be alone

Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'


Ready to make an entrance, so back on up


'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip, shit up


Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble


Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble


Ain't nuttin' but a G thang, baby, two loc'ed out niggaz  so we're crazy


'Death Row', is the label that pays me


Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this


(Hell, yeah)


But uhh, back to the lecture at hand


Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand


From a young G's perspective and before me dig out


A bitch I have to find a contraceptive


You never know she could be earnin' her man


And learnin' her man and at the same time burnin' her man


Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant


Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it


And that's realer than real deal Holyfield


And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel


Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk


I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff


It's like this, and like that, and like this, and uh


It's like that, and like this, and like that, and uh


It's like this, and like that, and like this, and uh


Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom


Well, I'm peepin', and I'm creepin', and I'm creepin'


But I damn near got caught, 'cause my beeper kept beepin'


Now, it's time for me to make my impression felt


So, sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt


You never been on a ride like this befoe


With a producer who can rap and control the maestro


At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick


You know, and I know, I flow some old funky shit


To add to my collection, the selection


Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke


If you do, you'll have no clue


On what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do


It's like this, and like that, and like this, and uh


It's like that, and like this, and like that, and uh


It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?


So just chill, 'til the next episode


Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangsta lean


Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens


It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double O P


D O double G Y, D O double G, ya see


Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic


Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite


Yeah, and it don't quit, I think they in the mood


For some motherfuckin' G shit


  (Hell, yeah)


So, Dre


(Whattup, Dogg?)


Gotta give em what they want


(What's that, G?)


We gotta break em off somethin'


(Hell, yeah)


And it's gotta be bumpin'


(City of Compton)


It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention


Mobbin' like a muh'fucker but I ain't lynchin'


Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucka niggaz mumble


When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie they all crumble


Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked


My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back


Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'


But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'


And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down


And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down


Yeah, and you don't stop, I told you I'm just like a clock


When I tick and I tock, but I'm never off


Always on to the break of dawn, C O M P T O N


And the city they call Long Beach, puttin' the shit together


Like my nigga D O C, no one can do it better

In the park where I can meet you

What started the trend of them Dazzey Duks
Ever since the summer of the 90s
Girls had a deal with the future behind
See many terms they use to express
We're talking about the butt cheeks not the breasts
Baby got back, junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo, need some fries with that shake
See many terms they use to relate
I love the girls with the big old booties
Right up front they call em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks hanging from the jeans
Even city girls can be country things
So if you get it got it good to dip to dug out
Dem damn Dazzey Duks are turning out
Sing!

Yeah they be kicking it sweet
While all the brothers show thier freak
And check out the way they step
Make a brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
And they're tan to the top all the way
But it don't matter what kinda legs you like
Still be kicking if those legs are lily white
So it makes no difference to you
As long as you're kicking them Dazzey Duks

If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you


But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl


Allow me some time to play with your mind


And you'll get there again and again


Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed


Take your time 'cause we've got all night, ooh


You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs


And let me know what you like, if you like I'll go


Down, down, down, down, da, down, down


I'll hold you in my hand and maybe


Your smooth and shiny feels so good


Against my lips, sugar


I want you so bad

Of lovers sleeping tight


Are rolling like thunder now


As I look in your eyes


I hold on to your body


And feel each move you make


Your voice is warm and tender


A love that I could not forsake


'Cause I am your lady


And you are my man


Whenever you reach for me


I'll do all that I can


Lost is how I'm feeling, lying in your arms


When the world outside's too


Much to take


That all ends when I'm with you


Even though there may be times


It seems I'm far away


Never wonder where I am


'Cause I am always by your side


'Cause I am your lady


And you are my man


Whenever you reach for me


I'll do all that I can


We're heading for something


Somewhere I've never been


Sometimes I am frightened


But I'm ready to learn


Of the power of love


The sound of your heart beating


Made it clear


Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on


Is light years away

To have it swept away

Can You Feel the Love Tonight,Elton John,1994,18,https://www.songlyrics.com/elton-john/can-you-feel-the-love-tonight-lyrics/,"There's a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are

Fantastic Voyage,Coolio,1994,20,https://www.songlyrics.com/coolio/fantastic-voyage-lyrics/,"Come on, y'all, let's take a ride
Don't you say shit, just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
'Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab your gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it, kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin', ain't no crippin'
Ain't no punk ass nigga's set trippin'
Everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat, get yo' ass out the kitchen
We on a mission
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide, slippity slide
With switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide, who ride?
No valley low enough or mountain high
I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life
And maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside
Without livin' in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searching and I keep on looking
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
'Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
'Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide, slippity, slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide, who ride?
That's why I pack my 45
Life is a bitch and then you die
Still tryin' to get a peace of the apple pie
Every game ain't the same 'cause the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange? Ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work, then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hop, hop, hop your five quickly down the block
Stay suckafree and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart, son, if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody cryin', ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worried, everybody's tryin'
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have something, you better start frontin'
What ya gonna do when the 5 roll by?
You better be ready, so you can ride
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide, slippity, slide
When you're living in a city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide, who ride?
You better be ready when the 5 roll by
Just roll along, that's what you do
Just roll along, that's right
Just roll along, that's what you do

Waterfalls,TLC,1995,2,https://www.songlyrics.com/tlc/waterfalls-lyrics/,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
Another body laying cold in the gutter.
Listen to me.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Y'all don't hear me.
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

I seen rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls.
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.

Run-Around,Blues Traveler,1995,14,https://www.songlyrics.com/blues-traveler/runaround-lyrics/,"Oh, once upon a midnight dearies
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said
Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies
And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when you're feeling open I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully
But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround
Is it a sure fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down
And shake me and my confidence
About a great many things
But I've been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings
Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch
Well, I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme so don't you feed me a line
But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround

When all it does is slow me down
Tra la la la la bomba dear this is the pilot speaking
And I've got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh, sure the banner may be torn
And the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full
Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay so be that way, I hope and pray
That there's something left to say
But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround

I guess I'm not that good anymore
But that's just me
I will love you baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day

Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
Touch your lips and hold you near
When you say your prayers understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needin' to hear
I wish I was him with these words of mine
To say to you till the end of time
That I will love you baby
Always
And I'll be there forever and a day

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay

Ravyon
Sun and fun in the
Atmosphere, oh yes
In the summertime when
The weather is high
You can stretch right up
And touch the sky
When the weather is fine
You've got women
You've got women
On your mind
I'm gonna drive and ride and
See now what I can find
Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie

Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey
Sting like bumble bee

Pretty little women
Sexy as can be
Sweet as honey

It's a summertime affair
In the atmosphere
I man love off her attire
And the clothes she wear
Some burn off them with tyre
And a draw down a gear
Some a shine up wax up
Not a sign of snare
Got to be rolling in my
Christas so the girl them stare
This is Shaggy and Rayvon
As your ultimate pair
Taking care of our career
So tell the world beware
'Cause it's a brand new
Selection for your musical ear
We say what we want and
We say what we need
And we love everybody
And we do as we please
And when the weather is fine,
We go fishin' we
Go fishin' in the sea
We are happy to live life
That's our philosophy
Now if her daddy's rich
Take her out for a meal
And if her daddy's poor
Then do as you feel
Speedin down the lane even
Thought the speed limit's 25
And when the sun goes down
I'll make it with my cutie pie
Sweat a run off her body
With her caramel skin
I man smiled at her she
Looked at me and grinned
I offered her a drink she said
Juice and Gin
And I whispered in her ear
I asked how you doin
Where was it that I reside
And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance
Her eyes sparkling
Just her voice and what
She said let my poor head spin
Raggamuffin Shaggy
With a musical swing
I say
Pretty little woman
Sexy as can be
Sweet as a honey

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside
And nobody knows it but me
Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumbling down
I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around
(Chorus)
The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but me
I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm trembling inside
And nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past 3
I'm screamin' at night if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is calling you
And nobody knows it but me
How blue can I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now
You know I'll be lovin' you still
(Chorus)
Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me
Said when the nights are lonely

I Love You Always Forever,Donna Lewis,1996,8,https://www.songlyrics.com/donna-lewis/i-love-you-always-forever-lyrics/,"Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists, of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer nights
Secret moments shared within the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near or far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
You've got
The most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got

Under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness
A magical time

I'm gonna pack my tears away
Got no cause to look back

All make a change darling

And don't nobody want no two time losers oh no
And ain't nobody gonna love you like you are
If you take whatever he brings your way, oh no no no

But we can't demand respect without change

We must go our own way

For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for, baby
This is love
This is more than a crush, yeah
It was Harlem at the rukus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that
So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at them legs, god damn, they look so soft, so fine
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him for five months, that's right
Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't wanna violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching your body with my tongue girl all night
I wonder one day could it be
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead
Hey lover
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife, no longer my girl
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he loves you
So, I'ma keep all these feelings aside, that's right
Keep my dreams alive until the right time
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush

 Something About the Way You Look Tonight,Elton John,1997,1,https://www.songlyrics.com/elton-john/-something-about-the-way-you-look-tonight-lyrics/,"There was a time


I was everything and nothing all in one


When you found me


I was feeling like a cloud across the sun


I need to tell you


How you light up every second of the day


But in the moonlight


You just shine like a beacon on the bay


And I can't explain


But it's something about the way you look tonight


Takes my breath away


It's that feeling I get about you deep inside


And I can't describe


But it's something about the way you look tonight


Takes my breath away


The way you look tonight


With a smile


You pull the deepest secrets from my heart


In all honesty


I'm speechless and I don't know where to start


And I can't explain


But it's something about the way you look tonight


Oh, takes my breath away


It's that feeling I get about you deep inside


And I can't describe


But it's something about the way you look tonight


Takes my breath away

May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life

Never fading with the sunset

Where lives were torn apart

 Foolish Games,Jewel,1997,2,https://www.songlyrics.com/jewel/-foolish-games-lyrics/,"You took your coat off and stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.
And I watched from my window,
Always felt I was outside looking in on you.
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair,
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care.
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather.
Well in case you failed to notice,
In case you failed to see,
This is my heart bleeding before you,
This is me down on my knees, and...
These foolish games are tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.
You're always brilliant in the morning,
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee.
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you.
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar.
You'd teach me of honest things,
Things that were daring, things that were clean.
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean.
I hid my soiled hands behind my back.
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone
Off track with you.
Excuse me, think I've mistaken you for somebody else,
Somebody who gave a damn,
Somebody more like myself.
These foolish games are tearing me,
You're tearing me,
You're tearing me apart,
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart.
You're breaking my heart.
You took your coat off,
Stood in the rain,
You're always crazy like that.","breaking my; my heart.; you're always; heart. you're; in the; stood in; things that; always crazy; and your; apart, and",2

Pieces of you


you were meant for me


i hear the clock, it's six a.m. / i feel so far from where i've been / got my eggs and my pancakes too / got my maple syrup, everything but you

dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you


called my momma, she was out for a walk / consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk / picked up a paper, it was more bad news / more hearts being broken or people being used


put on my coat in the pouring rain / saw a movie it just wasn't the same / 'cause it was happy and i was sad / it made me miss you oh so bad


dreams last so long / even after you're gone / i know you love me / and soon you will see / you were meant for me / and i was meant for you


go about my business, i'm doing fine / besides, what would i say if i had you on the line / same old story, not much to say / hearts are broken every day


brush my teeth and put the cap back on / i know you hate it when i leave the light on / i pick a book up / turn the sheets down / take a deep breath and a good look around


put on my pj's and hop into bed / i'm half alive but i feel mostly dead / i try and tell myself it'll all be alright / i just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Before anything became between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
And what's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do, should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight but the feeling's just too strong
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna

Bitch,Meredith Brooks,1997,15,https://www.songlyrics.com/meredith-brooks/bitch-lyrics/,"I hate the world today
You're so good to me
I know but I can't change
Tried to tell you
But you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet
Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see
The softer side
I can understand
How you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything
All rolled into one
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it
Any other way
So take me as I am, this may mean
You'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that
When I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change
And today won't mean a thing
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it
Any other way
Just when you think, you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it
Any other way
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it
Any other way","i'm a; i'm your; a bitch,; any other; bitch, i'm; it any; other way; want it; wouldn't want; you know",4

I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
I want something else

Goodbye

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish it could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again
Said how do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place
Where you said?
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
And when the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face
Down on the mattress one
And you hold me and we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right
And I want something else
To get me through this life baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye...
Cause I am barely breathing
And I can't find the air
Don't know who I am kidding

And I could stand here waiting
A fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price
The price that I would pay
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction? I can only feel the pain

Will it ever change?

The Boy Is Mine
1-You need to give it up, had about enough


  It's not hard to see, the boy is mine


  I'm sorry that you, seem to be confused


  He belongs to me, the boy is mine


I think it's time we got this straight


Let's sit and talk face to face


There is no way you could mistake him for your man


Are you insane?


See I know that you may be just a bit jealous of me


'Cause' you're blind


If you can't see that his love is all in me


See I try to hesistate, I didn't want to say what he told me


He said without me he couldn't make through the day


Ain't that a shame


Maybe you misunderstood, plus I can't see


How he could wanna take time and that's all good


All of my love was all it took


(repeat)


Must you do the things you do keep on acting like a fool


You need to know it's me not you well


If you didn't know it girl, it's true


I think that you should realize and try to understand why


He is a part of my life, I know its killing you inside


You can say what, you wanna say


What we have you can't take


From the truth you can't escape


I can tell the real from the fake


When will you get the picture


You're the past I'm the future


Get away it's my time to shine if you didn't know the boy is mine


(rpt 1)


You can't destroy this love I've found


Your silly games I won't allow


The boy is mine without a doubt


You might as well throw in the towel


What makes you think that he wants you


When I'm the one that brought him to special places in my heart


It was my lovin' from the start?

Candle in the Wind 1997 ,Elton John,1998,8,https://www.songlyrics.com/elton-john/candle-in-the-wind-1997--lyrics/,"Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned our long before
Your legend ever will
Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And you footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills

I Dont Want to Wait,Paula Cole,1998,10,https://www.songlyrics.com/paula-cole/i-dont-want-to-wait-lyrics/,"So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye
She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?
I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?
He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters
I don't want to to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry?
You look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
So breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the love in every eye

Once more you open the door and you're


Here in my heart and my heart will go on and on

Knowing it should have been you
And what's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you

Should I do exactly what I feel inside

I do, any and everything, do you want to?
Make your girl say ""Ooh, ooh, why's he so fly high?""

You can get mad if you want to
Do whatever you want but she still gona give it up
She likes it my way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps runnin' back to see me do it

Bad ass senorita's two seaters for kicks
New kick's all in the mix
Don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catchin' bricks don't concern me
So forget it lil' midget, my mind on 7 digits'
Before I pay heavens' sky's a visit, now dig it
I'm pullin' all stops, pullin' down all spots
Sayin' you can't front on me
So from this day forth you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the major league
That's why your girlfrien's paging me
And she know like, he know
You don't see her like I see her

Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, 'fraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of giving in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinkin'
I should make a move, but I won't (I should, I should)

Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move, but I won't

I felt it was coming the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night discover I love you

And look how we are carrying on
Trying to say things to get me to stay

Every Morning,Sugar Ray,1999,8,https://www.songlyrics.com/sugar-ray/every-morning-lyrics/,"Every morning there's a halo hangin'
From the corner of my girlfriend's four post bed
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand
Couldn't understand how to work it out
Once again as predicted
Left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

Shut the door baby, shut the door baby

Nobodys Supposed to Be Here,Deborah Cox,1999,9,https://www.songlyrics.com/deborah-cox/nobodys-supposed-to-be-here-lyrics/,"How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind
I've spent all my life on a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
The heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken oh, it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say, ""Love wins again""
So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here
How did you get here? Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no, nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind
This time I swear I'm through but if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things
So I placed my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

And her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

So much to do, so much to see

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're a rock star get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

Angel,Sarah McLachlan,1999,18,https://www.songlyrics.com/sarah-mclachlan/angel-lyrics/,"Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
The storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness
Oh this glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here",of the; arms of; in the; the angel; the arms; find some; that you; angel may; comfort here; may you,5

I could change my life to better suit your mood

You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah

But I'll tell you one thing

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue

The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart
'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
And suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
Slow and steady rush

I can feel you breathe, just breathe
In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
Closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know

Everything You Want,Vertical Horizon,2000,5,https://www.songlyrics.com/vertical-horizon/everything-you-want-lyrics/,"Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you

Kryptonite,3 Doors Down,2000,15,https://www.songlyrics.com/3-doors-down/kryptonite-lyrics/,"I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind

After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then

If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there a holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

No no no no no no no
You called me strong, you called me weak, but still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head, if not for me then you'd be dead

Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me),Train,2001,4,https://www.songlyrics.com/train/drops-of-jupiter-tell-me-lyrics/,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, heyÂ 
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself out there?
Â 
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey
Â 
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
Â 
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And then you missed me
While you were looking for yourself out there
Â 
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?
Â 
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
Â 
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar

I think I'm scared

Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch, I'm drastic
Why this? Why that? Lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writin' well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Gizelle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
And if I had to give you more
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a ganster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path, wanna smile up at me
Now while you grittin' your teeth
Frustration, baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more that you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes
And if I had to give you more
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me in
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, glock shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin', sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D R E
Back track, think back, E V E
Do you like that? Ooh, you got to, I know you
Had you in a trance, first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Dancin' much, get it all? Now I'm complete, uh huh
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double R, can't crawl
Beware 'cuz I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

Thank You,Dido,2001,8,https://www.songlyrics.com/dido/thank-you-lyrics/,"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad
it's not so bad
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
and even if I'm there, they'll all imply that I might not last the
day
and then you call me and it's not so bad
it's not so bad and
I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
just to be with you is having the best day of my life
Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking through and
through
then you handed me a towel and all I see is you
and even if my house falls down now, I wouldn't have a clue
because you're near me and

Wherever You Will Go,The Calling,2002,5,https://www.songlyrics.com/the-calling/wherever-you-will-go-lyrics/,"So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face
If a greater wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Well then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love
I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Or wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised
It got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then

Said, Ã¢â¬Â½You act like you're ready but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it goÃ¢â¬Â

Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else, you got it bad
When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, it don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars, you can have it all then
Flowers, cards and candy, I do it just 'cause I'm
Said, Ã¢â¬Â½I'm fortunate to have you girlÃ¢â¬Â
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm your girl, your my man
Promise to love you the best I can
See I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see that you got it bad
You got it, you got it bad when you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad if you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody, you got it bad
You got it, you got it bad when you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad if you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody","you got; got it; it bad; bad when; when you're; no, no,; got it,; it, you; and you; but you",15

And everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty
And everything is so messed up
Preoccupied without you

I stumble then I crawl
You could be my someone
You could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you
From all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doin'
Imagine where you are

Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
Everyone is changing
There's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending
And let me know just how you feel
'Cause I am lost without you
I cannot live at all

Always on Time,Ja Rule featuring Ashanti,2002,12,https://www.songlyrics.com/ja-rule-featuring-ashanti/always-on-time-lyrics/,"Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in boots and shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sun shower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a 'Dear Ja' letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M O B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I N C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Oh I'm, feelin' like ya livin' a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home
Sometimes baby, but you're always, on time
Checkin' for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way
You freak me baby I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

When I roll 20 deep, it's always drama in da club
N***** I heard I roll with Dre, everybody show me love
When you sell like Eminem you get plenty of groupie love
But homie ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that ****** roll that **** up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few ****** but I don't walk with a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying, ""50, you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York they surely will tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused, man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind

That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look homey, I done came up and I ain't change
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Oh you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar, toasting to the good life
Moved out the hood, now trying to pull me back, right?
When my junk get to pumpin' in da club it's on
I wink my eye at ya chick, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
If you're talking 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me
'Cause go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
Then watch the money pile up
Or we can go upside their head with a bottle of bub
Come on, they know where we be
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
You can find me in da club, bottle full of bub
Mama, I got what you need, if you need to feel a buzz
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
Don't try to act like you don't know
Where we been neither
We in the club all the time
It's about to pop off

Geah! History in the making
Part two!
It's so crazy right now
I look and stare so deep in your eyes (I-)
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (hey)

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?"" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care

And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung, and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me

How can you see into my eyes like open doors


leading you down into my core


where Iâve become so numb without a soul my spirit sleeping somewhere cold 


until you find it there and lead it back home

call my name and save me from the dark


(Wake me up)


bid my blood to run


(I canât wake up)


before I come undone

save me from the nothing Iâve become


now that I know what Iâm without


you can't just leave me


breathe into me and make me real


bring me to life

Wake me up inside

call my name and save me from the dark

before I come undone


(Save me)


save me from the nothing Iâve become


frozen inside without your touch without your love darling only you are the life among the dead


all this time I can't believe I couldn't see


kept in the dark but you were there in front of me


Iâve been sleeping a thousand years it seems


got to open my eyes to everything


without a thought without a voice without a soul


don't let me die here


there must be something more


bring me to life

Hey girl, what your name is?

Your body is banging mamma
But where your brains at?

I'm still the same cat when I was young
I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw

Banging personality conversate when the time right

They be like, ""He the man"" when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap
And the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile
(Wha)
Because I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy, man
They say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money
(I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting

You are now riding
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl
If I feel off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
And in bed if I used to my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me? Girl
Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad 'cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said, it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?

Could you love me in a Bentley? Could you love me on a bus?

You know your melody can move me


And when I'm feelin' blue


The guitars come through to soothe me


Thanks for the joy you've given me


I want you to know I believe in your song


And rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony


You helped me along, you're makin' me strong

Never to return again but always in my heart, oh
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right
(It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips into
Every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me

There's many things I wish I didn't do


But I continue learning


I never meant to do those things to you


And so I have to say before I go


That I just want you to know


I've found a reason for me


To change who I used to be


A reason to start over new


And the reason is you


I'm sorry that I hurt you


It's something I must live with every day


And all the pain I put you through


I wish that I could take it all away


And be the one who catches all your tears


That's why I need you to hear


I've found a reason for me


To change who I used to be


A reason to start over new

My Goodies, My Goodies, My Goodies
Not my goodies!
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more.
And it's a wrap
Tell Valet to bring my Lac
And I ain't coming back
So you can put a car right there.
I'm the truth
And ain't got nothin' to prove.
An you can ask anybody
Cuz they seen me do it.
Barricades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em.
Throw all the dirt you want it's no use.
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit.
(I love you boo)
Yeah freaky Petey love you too.
Ha Ha
You know how I do.
You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl.
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for:
Sexy, independent,
Down to spend it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it.
I bet you want the goodies.
Bet you thought about it.
Got you all hot and bothered.
Mad cause I talk around it.
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not going home with you.
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie.
If you ain't
Sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it so you already know.
I'm not being too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Tryna hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not being too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it
So damn hot but so young.
Still got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shawty
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is.
Bad is when you capable of beatin' the baddest.
I been workin' at it ever since i came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet but I'm gettin' better at it.
Matter of fact,
Lemme tell it to you one mo' again
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey!)
Ain't naa chick in here dat I can't have
Bada boom bada bam ba bam!
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top.
No you can't call me later
And I don't want your number.
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'.

Yo, two step wit' me, two step wit' me

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two, to the one
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from a hun
While she goin' down I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun

Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass now I'm lookin' at her thighs
Why she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl you 21 girl that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' wit' those fries
If so baby, can I get them super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three, to the two
She stay feelin' on my Johnson, right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' thats cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run wit' the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man, son of a bitch
Brushed it off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Wit' some orange juice man, this some good 'ish
Homeboy trippin' cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me

Say she three months pregnant and she's keepin' it

Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye, bye to our relationship

When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

And when I pop my collar I make 'em smile
I need a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets
That know how to cook 'cause a nigga like to eat spaghetti

I'll treat you like milk, I'll do nothing but spoil you

I switch whips like kicks I'm a balla

And we can meet up the next day and chill
But I'm always on the road, baby girl, that's how I live

I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine
We don't have to be in love, we can just be friends
I will be right there, beginning to the end
I can bring my girls, you can bring your friends
We can both have fun, don't want this stuff to end
They say love is pain and pain is love
I know ya Momma mad 'cause you talk to a thug
You think you know my type but you ain't got no clue
About what a real nigga like me do
I like to stack my bread and flip my chips
And I can change ya life if ya get wit' Flip
I take private jets to Vegas, man
It's twenty grand each pick 'cause I'm major man
We can cruise the world in a Bentley Azure
But don't worry, the chauffeur open the door
You couldn't ask for more 'cause we got it all
'Cause you're my baby girl right? Right?
Sunshine, I can call you my baby boy
You can call me your baby girl
Maybe we can spend some time
I can be your sunshine

You can call me your baby girl

We Belong Together,Mariah Carey,2005,1,https://www.songlyrics.com/mariah-carey/we-belong-together-lyrics/,"Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Sweet love, yeah
I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
Ã¢â¬~Cause I didn't know you
Ã¢â¬~Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Ã¢â¬~Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, Ã¢â¬~cause baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Ã¢â¬~Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night
When you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me
""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute
This is too deep
(Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
And it's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Ã¢â¬~Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please
Ã¢â¬~Cause we belong together

The only one that I have ever known

Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
""What's fucked up?"" and ""Everything's all right""
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone

Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside Anymore

How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest
Now, he takes off her dress
Now, let me go
And, I just can't look it's killing me
I'm taking control
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
I'm coming out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down

Damn baby all I need is a lil' bit
A lil' bit of this, a lil' bit of that
Get it crackin in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up, and, down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin to beef, I'm tryin to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin and touchin a lil' bit
Get to lickin it, a lil' bit
This is 50, comin out your ster-e-o
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get, your bitch, she on me dawg
She must, ta heard, about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
#1 on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like oh man
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin, party jumpin, I said loud and clear
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit

Bad Day,Daniel Powter,2006,1,https://www.songlyrics.com/daniel-powter/bad-day-lyrics/,"Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just ahead of the law
You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say

How you doin young lady
That feelin that you givin really drivin' me crazy
You dont have ta play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke
If you looking for a girl thatll treat you right
If you lookin for her in the day time with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
Whats the problem I dont see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
Im curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it

Where you at, do you mind if I come through

Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team, so does everybody else

Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, try and catch me ridin dirty
Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tense, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see these gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Now ridin with a new chick, she like, ""Hold up""
Next to the Playstation controlla
It's a full clip and my pistolla, send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin' bone, ain't tryin' have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned up all the way to the maximum
I got speakers, some niggaz tryin' jack for some
But we packin' somethin' and what we have for um
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum, security cell
I'm grippin' oak, music loud and I'm tippin' slow
Twins steady twistin' like, 'Hit this dough'
D's behind and it's in re-throwed
Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change just like, ""Who is that producin'?""
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin'
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I still ain't losin'
They see me rollin', they hatin' patrollin'
And tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
My music so loud I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
I've been and smokin', holy shit 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big ole Excursion just swerve'n, all up in the curb'n
A nigga be sippin' on the Hennessey and the Gin again
It's in again we in the wind
Don't wanna hold up while I puff on the blunt
I roll another one up, and leave it like
We ain't givin' a fuck, I got a blunt up in my right hand
40 0z. in my lap, freezin' my balls
Rollin' up a tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep me and my dogs
Yo' I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five and I got heat
Glock, glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop pop hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, ""Fuck 'em all""
But I won't get caught up and brought
Up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Wonder if you want nigga it poppin' dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire
They see me rollin', they hatin' patrollin'
And tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
My music so loud I'm swangin'
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
You wouldn't think it so, I tried to let cha go
Turn on my blanker light, and then I swang it slow
And they upset for fa sho' 'cause they think they know
That they catchin' me with plenty of the drank and dro'
So they get behind me, tryin' to take my tags
Look in my rear view and they smilin'
Thinkin' they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin'
Steady denyin' that it's racial profilin'
Houston, Texas you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
Bein' the balla that I am, I'm talk to them not givin' a
Damn about them not feelin' my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty
Bet you'll be leavin' with an even madder mood
Then I'll laugh at you then I'll have to cruise
Ya my number two on some old school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the laws, tell 'em, ""We hate you""
I could be tough tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin' down, sittin' crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, findin' a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm 'bout to pull up at your home, and it's on
They see me rollin', they hatin' patrollin'
And tryin' to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin' to catch me ridin dirty, tryin' to catch me ridin dirty

I wanna be with you, gotta be with you, need to be with you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, ooh
Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't build nothing overnight
'Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom they see that we did that, yes
It's so true that yes, we've been through it, yes
We got real shit, yes, see baby we've been
Too strong for too long and I can't be without you baby
And I'll be waiting up until you get home
'Cause I can't sleep without you baby
Anybody who's ever loved, you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby, yeah
I got a question for you
See I already know the answer but still I wanna ask you
Would you lie? No, make me cry? No
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love, yes
I'll be faithful, yes, I'm for real, yes
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been too strong for too long and I can't be without you baby, oh
And I'll be waiting up until you get home

Good or bad, thick and thin, right or wrong, all day everyday, hey
Now if you're down on love or don't believe
This ain't for you, no, this ain't for you and if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it's true, come on, come on, come on
Well, let me see you put your hands up, hands up
Fellas tell your lady she's the one, fellas tell your lady she's the one, oh
Put your hands up, hands up ladies let him know he's got your love

Over My Head (Cable Car),The Fray,2006,13,https://www.songlyrics.com/the-fray/over-my-head-cable-car-lyrics/,"I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's got to be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
Find another friend and you discard
As you lose the arguments in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's all on
And suddenly I become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and its effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head, over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind
Everyone knows she's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in over my head

Call up that chick and see if she's home

Because you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you

With a pool stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo

Of his pretty little low Mercedes Benz
Carved my name into his leather seat
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
Slashed a hole in all 4 tires
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on 3 dollars
Worth of that bathroom polo

Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that, after that
Try to get you back

And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye
God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
What you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
it even makes a difference to try
Yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Although)
So this is goodbye
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
Cause I, still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
Yeah
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
So this is goodbye

I see the one, 'cause she be that lady, hey!
I feel you creeping, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more

Pull in the parking lot slow with the Ã¢â¬ lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardobe intact now
I feel it, don and crack now
Ooh I see it, don't let back now
I'ma call her then I put the mack down

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil' drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, and she's like, ""You're...""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place""
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing

I can sell a mill
Say you nothing on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
Nigga say that we lost it
So I'm ma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
'Coz niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the H
I watch you get it on the floor
And if you needed hyphy
I take it to the bay
Frisco to Sac town
They do it e'ryday
Coppin' a Hollywood
Soon as I hit LA
I'm in that low low
I do it the Cali way
And when I hit the Chi
People say that I'm fly
They like the way I dress
They like my attire
They love how I move crowds
From side to side
They ask me how I do it
And simply I reply

Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another bitch, another drop
16 bars, 24 pop, 44 songs
Nigga gimme what you got
I'm in there driving cars
Push them off the lot
I'm into shutting stores down just so I can shop
If you need a bird
I can get it chopped
Tell me what you need you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my hommie black
Meet me on the ave
I hit wash heights
We into big spinners
See my pimping never dragged
Find me with different women
That you niggas never had
For those who say they know me
Know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between
You'd better focus on the beam
I keep it so feen
The way you see me lean
And when I say I'm hot
My nigga this is what I mean
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, yeah

Shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid
And I say yeah I paid a quap?
And then I hit the switch
That take away the top
So chicks around the way
They call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell 'em all about
We hit the studio
They say they like how I record
I gave you black train
And I did you wrong
So every time I see them
They tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear
Then comes the gear
So when I hit the room
The shorties stop and stare
Niggas start to hate
Rearrange their face
But little do they know
I keep them things by waist
'Side I reply
Nobody gotta die
Similar to lil wiz
'Coz I got the fire

I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking around
Thinking I'm going crazy
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goalIs to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the rush
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say

Viva la Vida,Coldplay,2008,13,https://www.songlyrics.com/coldplay/viva-la-vida-lyrics/,"I used to rule the world


Seas would rise when I gave the word


Now in the morning I sleep alone


Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice


Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes


Listen as the crowd would sing


""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""


One minute I held the key


Next the walls were closed on me


And I discovered that my castles stand


Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand


I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing


Roman Catholic choirs are singing


Be my mirror, my sword and shield


My missionaries in a foreign field


For some reason I can't explain


Once you go there was never


Never an honest word


And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind


Blew down the doors to let me in


Shattered windows and the sound of drums


People couldn't believe what I'd become


Revolutionaries wait


For my head on a silver plate


Just a puppet on a lonely string


Oh who would ever want to be king?


I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing


Roman Catholic choirs are singing


Be my mirror, my sword and shield


My missionaries in a foreign field


For some reason I can't explain


I know Saint Peter won't call my name


Never an honest word


But that was when I ruled the world


I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

I Kissed a Girl,Katy Perry,2008,14,https://www.songlyrics.com/katy-perry/i-kissed-a-girl-lyrics/,"This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what, good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it
Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

Love Story,Taylor Swift,2009,5,https://www.songlyrics.com/taylor-swift/love-story-lyrics/,"We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes & the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say ""Hello"", little did I know...
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", & I said...
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince & I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
...
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said...
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground & pulled out a ring & said
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you & that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh oh oh

Just like my mind where I'm goin'


No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes


No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll


I like my jewelry that's always on whoa

Call up my homies, it's on


Then pop in the next 'cause this mix'll be ours


We keep a fade-away shot

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

You belong with me

I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile
That can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile
Since she brought you down.
You say you're fineâI know you better than that

I wear sneakers

All alone, smoking his last cigarette

And all I needed was a call that never came

Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded

And you never left me no messages


You never sent me no letters

Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I
Ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I've lost all control
And I need you now
And I don't know how
I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whiskey
Can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before
And I wonder if I
Ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call

Let's take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees
(Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek
(At us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be fallin' in love
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it one lock
West-coast represent
Now put your hands up
Sex on the beach
We've got white sand in our stilettos
We freak in my jeep

Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild, wild west-coast

I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak, she drive a Jeep
And live on the Beach
I'm okay, I won't play, I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everyday
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zuchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Airplanes,B.o.B featuring Hayley Williams,2010,6,https://www.songlyrics.com/bob-featuring-hayley-williams/airplanes-lyrics/,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
Are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
Are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than in this
'Cause after all the partyin', and smashin', and crashin'
And all the glitz, and the glam, and the fashion
And all the pandemonium, and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays, we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky
Are like shooting stars? (Shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky

With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun (sun)
This is how I lost more than I had ever won (won)
And honestly I ended up with none
There's no much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking, baby, I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wondering
If there was something that you wanna know (that you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go) go (go) go

She Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, with her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out, and she still shine
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter's day
Hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves
Steal your love and leave
I like the way you walk, and if you walkin' my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I let you be the judge, an'-an'-and I'm the case

I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody

To be losing (losin', losin')
And be hopeless (hopeless, hopeless)

Said, ""Your word get me open""

Where your clothes is
I'm only lovin' for the moment (for the moment, for the moment)

Firework,Katy Perry,2011,3,https://www.songlyrics.com/katy-perry/firework-lyrics/,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?
You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, oh
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, oh
You're gonna leave 'em falling downYou don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

And you're treated like a fool
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
So raise your, so raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways
All my underdogs, we will never, never be
Anything but loud and nitty gritty, dirty little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong

Born This Way,Lady Gaga,2011,18,https://www.songlyrics.com/lady-gaga/born-this-way-lyrics/,"It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up 'cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
""There's nothing wrong with loving who you are""
She said, ""'Cause he made you perfect, babe""
""So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say""
I'm beautiful in my way

In the religion of the insecure

A different lover is not a sin

Fuckin Perfect,Pink,2011,19,https://www.songlyrics.com/pink/fuckin-perfect-lyrics/,"Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss ""No way, it's all good,"" it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing, underestimated
Look, I'm still around
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
You're so mean when you talk about yourself
You were wrong
Change the voices in your head
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look how we all made it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same
Pretty pretty please, don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty pretty please, if you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line, and we try try try
But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Estrange ourselves, and we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that? Why do I do that?
Yeah, oh, oh baby, pretty baby

Somebody That I Used to Know,Gotye featuring Kimbra,2012,1,https://www.songlyrics.com/gotye/somebody-that-i-used-to-know-lyrics/,"Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends, collect your records, and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

I know you're trying to forget

Payphone,Maroon 5 featuring Wiz Khalifa,2012,4,https://www.songlyrics.com/maroon-5/payphone-lyrics/,"I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?
Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone?

Where are the plans we made for two?

I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care

I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now, when you see me I'm stunning
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up, or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone, so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show, you can tell it, I'm balling
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want

Wild Ones,Flo Rida featuring Sia,2012,11,https://www.songlyrics.com/flo-rida/wild-ones-lyrics/,"Hey I heard you were a wild one, oooh
If I took you home and be your home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, oooh
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music,
I might lose it
Blast through the roof,
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it
I don't care tonight, she don't care
We like almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping those doubts
Surfin' the crowd
Oooh oooh
Said I gotta be the man, I'm the head of my fam,
Mike check, one two, oooh
Shut them down in the club when the Playboy does,
And they all get loose, loose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred supermodels
Hey I heard you were a wild one, oooh
If I took you home and be your home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, oooh
Party rocker, fo' sho' stopper
More shampoo
Number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes
Riled up baby to the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me 'bout pain
Tell 'em this, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail, were you insane?
Hey I heard you were a wild one, oooh
If I took you home and be your home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, oooh
I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
I show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you'd see
Tear up that body, dominatrix, till you had enough
I heard you like wilds, don't lie
Hey I heard you were a wild one, oooh
If I took you home and be your home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you

Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,2012,12,https://www.songlyrics.com/adele/set-fire-to-the-rain-lyrics/,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better
'Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain

Some Nights,Fun,2012,14,https://www.songlyrics.com/fun/some-nights-lyrics/,"Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh woah) What do I stand for?
(Oh woah) What do I stand for?
Most nights I don't know anymore
(Oh, oh woah, oh whoah, oh)
(Oh, oh woah, oh whoah, oh)
This is it, boys, this is war
what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
That's alright (that's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am
Oh, who am I?
Mmm
Mmm
Well, some nights I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights I'm scared you'll forget me again

Washed my hands and I died for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

When I hear songs, they sound like a swan, so come on

Oh, come on!
Well, that is it guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?
My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called love
When I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible lies
(Oh, oh woah, oh whoah, oh)
(Oh, oh woah, oh whoah, oh)
The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up but we'd both agree

And landed on my feet

Giving up's not an option and gotta get it in
Witness I got the heart of 20 men
No fear go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that funk that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now

I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you

Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me

I'll be there for you

My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away

And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Go Uptown, New York City Biiitch
Some Spanish girls love me like Iâm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke Iâm out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, Fuckinâ women ainât much to do
Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ainât shit changed
How you feel? how you feel? how you feel?
Twenty five sittinâ on 25 mil uhh
Iâm in the building and Iâm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, Iâmma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla whenever that stop
My team good, we donât really need a mascot
Tell Tune âlight one, pass it like a relayâ
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbs, shout to Gibo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if im fuckin with her, I donât really need her
Aohhh, Thatâs how you feel man?
Thatâs really how you feel?
Cause the pimpinâ ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill

Then again maybe she will

And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch

One thing I ask of you
Let me be the one you back that ass up to (come on)
Go, from Malibu to Paris, boo
Yeah, had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare, would I?
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothing like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair for you (you like it)
So I'm just watching and waiting
For you to salute the truly pimping
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimping
Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
What you don't like work?
Hey! (Everybody, get up)
Baby, can you breathe?
I got this from Jamaica
It always works for me
Dakota to Decatur
No more pretending (hey, hey, hey)
'Cause now you winning (hey, hey, hey)
Here's our beginning (hey, hey, hey)
I always wanted a

Good to see you
Come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright, okay, uh
Alright, okay, alright, okay
Return of the Mack, get 'em
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift Shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yup
Bad, moonwalking, and this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it, and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track buzzing, halfway cross that city
With the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here
Nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Now they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
I go hard like I've got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on shark week
Raw, tell me go up, gone
Deuces goodbye, I've got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing that song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility, and now we keep marching, I said
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment

Mirrors,Justin Timberlake,2013,6,https://www.songlyrics.com/justin-timberlake/mirrors-lyrics/,"Aren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirror
And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here trying to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm looking right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Coming back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare 'cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

Things you never say to me, oh, oh

When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,2013,8,https://www.songlyrics.com/bruno-mars/when-i-was-your-man-lyrics/,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now,
our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
when our friends talk about you
all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little
when I hear your name
It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
caused the good strong woman like you
to walk out my life
now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made
and it hunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oh,
too young, too dumb to realize
that I should've bought you flowers
and held your hand
should I gave you all my hours
when I had the chance
take you to every party
cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
but she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
I know I'm probably too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
'Cause it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle

Royals,Lorde,2013,15,https://www.songlyrics.com/lorde/royals-lyrics/,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address,
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.
And we'll never be royals (royals).
It don't run in our blood,
That kind of luxe just ain't for us.
We crave a different kind of buzz.
Let me be your ruler (ruler),
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
Let me live that fantasy.
My friends and Iâwe've cracked the code.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
We didn't come from money.

Wake Me Up,Avicii,2013,19,https://www.songlyrics.com/avicii/wake-me-up-lyrics/,"Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself, and I
Didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over

Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'usses on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga trying to cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple

Yeah, yeah
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?

We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.
And we'll never be royals (royals).
It don't run in our blood,
That kind of luxe just ain't for us.
We crave a different kind of buzz.
Let me be your ruler (ruler),
You can call me queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
Let me live that fantasy.
My friends and Iâwe've cracked the code.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
We didn't come from money.
But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom.
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed,
And I'm in love with being queen.
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair.
And we'll never be royals (royals).
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us.

Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,2015,2,https://www.songlyrics.com/ed-sheeran/thinking-out-loud-lyrics/,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you till we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you win the better place

And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone

Blank Space,Taylor Swift,2015,7,https://www.songlyrics.com/taylor-swift/blank-space-lyrics/,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face!""
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

Take Me to Church,Hozier,2015,14,https://www.songlyrics.com/hozier/take-me-to-church-lyrics/,"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well
A-amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Oh, oh, amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife

Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
So hello from the other side

7 Years,Lukas Graham,2016,12,https://www.songlyrics.com/lukas-graham/7-years-lyrics/,"Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely.
Once I was seven years old.
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old.
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old.
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major.
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later.
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old.
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming.
Soon we'll be 30 years old.
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can bore me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me

Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs
I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone, but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said: ""tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me get a world that they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want

Understand what I'm speaking on if time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends, we don't take L's we just make M's
While y'all follow, we just make trends

Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my anger
I'm swimming in money
Swimming in liquor my liver is muddy
But it's all good I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here 'cause I'm sick with it Cudi

Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)
Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)
Despacito (yeh, yo)
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (yo)
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (yo)
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (yeh)

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' waist the world with my paystub

I get way too petty once you let me do the extras

Eat up your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Four years, no calls

And I, I, I, I, I can't stop
No, I, I, I, I, I can't stop

In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

But I can turn 'em inside out
I don't need no help
Got hips like honey
So thick and so sweet (Man)

On them downtown streets

With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there

But instead, I'm in the trap though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye
You know what I'm on, aye
Huncho Houdini is gone, aye
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it

Say You Wont Let Go,James Arthur,2017,11,https://www.songlyrics.com/james-arthur/say-you-wont-let-go-lyrics/,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most
I'm gonna love you 'til
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love, not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
Oh, darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darling, you look perfect tonight""
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Oh, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Mm, oh
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms

Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head

I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Shows up in a 2AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I
I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free

Brand new whip, just hopped in (ay, just hopped in)

I could pass that bitch like Stockton (it ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in
My body got rid of them toxins (mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh (give me)
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (he a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (don't)

Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (he do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" (It does)

I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (damn)

Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (ooh, scary obsession, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type, and she's Latin (that's fit)
Got my own flow, and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand-new sheets for the bed, they satin (soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then
My swag, they keep jackin' (keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' (verse, quit askin')

The way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you""

Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about

'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah

And pictured I was driving home to you

Can't drive past the places we used to go to

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say

I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true, my bad habits lead to you

A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off and they get to getting old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to getting old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes

The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side

On the count of three, bad bitches get money (get money)
Broke niggas to the left, we 'on't want it (hell nah)
If you ever see me broke, I'm prolly rocking a cast
Pretty face, no waist, with a big ol' bag, ha
Bad bitch, I could be your fantasy
I can tell you got big dick energy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me
But I might let you try it off the Hennessy
Make 'em sing to this pussy like a melody
And if your bitch ain't right, I got the remedy
It ain't too many niggas that can handle me

I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow

Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that
If I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (more than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life
Young blood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get
I want you to know that

We been rather wreckin' cars (hey bro, is that Jambo?)

Kickin' off power mirrors

Don't know, maybe for trial (ATL Jacob)

Say you my nigga, I'ma be your killer
Nobody gon' play with you when I'm with you
Go against any nigga, like, fuck this glitter
Skeet off third, I'm busy
I put it in for you, I spin for you
Whatever you with, I'm with it
How you gon' cross a nigga that was rockin' with you?
I got you lit in the city
I been multitaskin'
Rappin' and bein' a daddy to my lil' children
I been standin' on business
And spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' until I'm dizzy
I do all the smackin'
You ain't never stepped or helped with none of this killin'
You doin' a lot of cappin'
Watch when I catch you, I'ma whack you in front of the witness
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Damn, my nigga, you trippin'
We could've been superstars
Can't help it, now I'm reminiscing
Remember when we was jackin' cars
Now, you better keep your distance
'Cause it's not safe for you
You switched like a pussy, lil' bitch
Trackhawk with the kit
Snatch off on the bitch when I slide
Nightlight on the blick
Bet I'm on my shit when I'm outside
Zoe done ran down
Caught him pants down, nigga, you shitted
I knew the Perc' was fake
But I still ate it 'cause I'm a gremlin
Yeah, Kutthroat Businezz, KTB, backdoor wide open
Wait 'til my sniper get out
All you niggas gon' die, time rollin'
Bustin' on my opponent
No half-steppin', crushin' my opps totally
We was just broke with no motion
Sleepin' on sofas, creepin' in houses like roaches
I done went cages, to stages, to cages
Now free me, baby, can't keep me, baby
I beat them cases, they already hate me
They gon' want me dead when I'm on probation
Oh, y'all think lil' Yak retarded?
Y'all ain't seen none yet, I promise
Niggas can't take me, niggas can't guard me

Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition

Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again

Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift,2023,4,https://www.songlyrics.com/taylor-swift/antihero-lyrics/,"I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell""
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

Maybe we'll make something

Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
See, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He say his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, it felt like I was drunk

I don't know much, but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do, and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak
To you, I'm just a man, to me, you're all I am

Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinking
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
That burns like hell when two soles meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight

You know you don't gotta pretend, baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake?
Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?

But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat

I work late, where I'm free from the phone

But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along, babe, don't get me wrong
You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat

Stick Season,Noah Kahan,2024,11,https://www.songlyrics.com/noah-kahan/stick-season-lyrics/,"As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must have had yourself a change of heart like
Halfway through the drive
'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
You kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad
No, I am no longer funny, 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me forever, now you still can't call me back
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)

If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (Please)

Hold my hand
You can hit while they watch, boy
Somethin' different about you
Love it when he hit and smack too
Baby, lemme lick on your tattoos
That's true that I like PDA
Take it to a seedy place
Suck a little dick in the bathroom
Who that man with the big strong hands
On her ass in the club with the paps? Baby, that's you
Front seat chillin' with the window down
I be ten toes down on the dash getting' fast food
Hope you can handle the heat
Put your name in the streets
Get used to my fans looking at you
Fuck what they heard, I don't fuck with them birds
I'm a mean kitty, don't get stabbed with the rat tooth
Boys be mad that I don't fuck incels
Girls hate too, gun to their pigtail
I love you, I wanna big chill
Boy, don't trip, I'll split a big bill
Take you 'round the world, they don't have to understand
Rub it in their face, put a rock on her hand

Hold me down when a hole need dick
Be my security, it's your therapy
With you I ain't holding shit back
When I need my space, you give that
When he broke my heart, you fixed that
With a long walk on the beach
Love it when they honk-honk on the street
When they see us zoom by in the Jeep
We a whole damn joint, we an energy
Baby, we could just ride on our enemies
They all wanna know how you get to me
Let 'em feel how they feel and be Philistines

"Good Luck, Babe!",Chappell Roan,2024,18,https://www.songlyrics.com/chappell-roan/good-luck-babe-lyrics/,"It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothin', but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof
I don't wanna call it off, but you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call ""Baby""
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
I'm clich, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air
I think I'm gonna call it off even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me ""Baby""
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Ooh, yeah
Ooh
And when you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me all of those years ago
You're standing face-to-face with ""I told you so""
You know I hate to say it, ""I told you so""
You know I hate to say, but, ""I told you so""
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (well, I told you so)
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)
Well, good luck, babe! (Well, good luck!)

Saturn,SZA,2024,19,https://www.songlyrics.com/sza/saturn-lyrics/,"If there's another universe
Please make some noise (noise)
Give me a sign (sign)
This can't be life
If there's a point to losing love
Repeating pain (why?)
It's all the same (same)
I hate this place
Stuck in this paradigm
Don't believe in paradise
This must be what hell is like
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze
Nirvana's not as advertised
There's got to be more, been here before
Oh (oh, ooh)
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Oh (oh, ooh)
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking
I always say
I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh
If karma's really real
How am I still here?
Just seems so unfair
I could be wrong though
If there's a point to being good
Then where's my reward?
The good die young and poor
I gave it all I could
Stuck in this terradome
All I see is terrible
Making us hysterical
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze
Nirvana's not as advertised
There's got to be more, been here before
Oh (oh, ooh)
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away

Snooze,SZA,2024,20,https://www.songlyrics.com/sza/snooze-lyrics/,"Ooh
I think I know
I'll touch that fire for you
I do that three, four times again, I testify for you
I told that lie, I'd kill that bitch
I do what all of them around you scared to do, I'm not
Long as you juggin' out here for me, I got it
Mobbing, scheming, looting, hide your bodies
Long as you dreaming 'bout me, ain't no problem
I don't got nobody, just with you right now
Tell the truth, I look better under you
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
I can't just snooze and miss the moment
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do
In a droptop ride with you, I feel like Scarface (Scarface)
Like that white bitch with the bob, I'll be your main one (main one)
Let's take this argument back up to my place (my place)
Sex remind you, I'm non violent, I'm your day one
We ain't have shit, yeah, it was magic, yeah
Smash and grab shit, yeah
Nasty habits take a hold when you not here
Ain't a home when you not here
Hard to grow when you not here, I'm sayin'
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
You just too important
Nobody do body like you do, you do
Main one, riding
How you fronting on me and I'm the main one trying?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lying?
How you threatening to leave and I'm the main one crying?
Just trying to be your everything
Main one, riding
How you fronting on me and I'm the main one trying?
How you blame it on me and you the main one lying?
How you threatening to leave and I'm the main one crying?
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?

Nobody do body like you do
I can't lose when I'm with you
How can I snooze and miss the moment?
